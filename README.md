# My Game Wishlist

An interactive website created with core web languages (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to process and store user input.

Users may fill out a simple form with game titles and other optional data, which is in turn validated, displayed, and stored in the browser's LocalStorage to persist across page reloads.
